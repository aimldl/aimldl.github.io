I recorded a video about making a Roli patch for the Montage here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXg_cEjWsBM&t=1s It's done for AWM2 but the same principles work for FM-X

This was done wired via a computer (raspberry pi for portability) rather than using a direct connection though. There are a couple of reasons why you might want to go via a computer. 

First, and most annoyingly, the Seaboard doesn't reset the aftertouch when starting a new note so you can get 'pings' when you press a new note and it starts with the AT value of the previous one. This is particularly annoying when playing very softly and legato - which I like to do on the Roli. You can get round this in software of course.
Secondly, the Seaboard has 'slide' mapped unalterably to CC 74 (brightness). which is a good default (it changes the filter cutoff) but sometimes I want it to do other things.
